# SHAP
Mayo Clinic Applied Statistics Seminar October 2019 Presentation



Originally conceived to solve a profit-sharing problem in game theory, shapley values have recently been applied in statistical model interpretability.  Highly accurate models are often increasingly complex and difficult to interpret, and as such we are forced to find a compromise between accuracy and interpretability. Methods to aid interpretation of complex models have been developed, but different methods can yield variable results.  SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) builds upon classic shapley value estimation to uniquely solve the problem of feature importance for individual model predictions.  Additionally, SHAP demonstrates enhancements in computational performance and alignment with human intuition over prior methods. We will overview a background of SHAP and present a demonstration of SHAP on a Gradient Boosting Machine model using ‘xgboost’ in R.
